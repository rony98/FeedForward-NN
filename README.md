# FeedForward Neural Network

A Feed Forward Neural Network which uses backpropagation to train weights/biases for digit recognition. The project includes training data containing thousands of images of digits and, included with each image is an integer representing what digit is within the image.

Additionally, the neural network has features that allow it to be updated real time from anywhere by using the Neural Network Extension android app which is a separate android project. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the application, no software is needed due to the included executable file.

But, in order to view the project, Visual Studio is recommended to be installed.

```
Install Visual Studio using the following URL:
https://mxa.codeplex.com/releases/view/618279
```

## Running Application

In order to run the application, a copy of the repository has to be cloned. After cloned the following executable needs to be run:
  
```
Client:
/NeuralNetworkV2/bin/Debug/NeuralNetworkV2.exe
```

Once the client is ran, the Neural Network application will run, giving the user multiple options. Depending on what needs to be done, different options can be chosen by typing the option number (1, 2, 3, etc.), followed by the ENTER key. Once done, follow the application's instructions in order to run whatever component that is needed.
